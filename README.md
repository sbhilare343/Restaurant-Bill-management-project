# Restaurant-Bill-management-project
C project in First Year

This programme uses basic code to create and save restaurant bills. To keep order information like the customer's name, the number of items, and item information like name, quantity, and price, it employs structures.

A straightforward menu with three choices is provided by the programme: create a new bill, search through prior bills, and exit.

The software asks for the customer name, the number of items, and then details such as the name, quantity, and price for each object when the user chooses the "generate bill" option. It computes the order's total cost and produces a bill header that includes the client's name and the date. The details, quantity, and overall price of each item are then printed on a bill body. The statement footer, which includes the subtotal, discount, tax, and overall total, is printed last. Additionally, the user is prompted to save the receipt to a file.

The software reads the previously saved bills from the file and prints them one at a time when the user chooses the "search bill" option.

As long as the user doesn't choose the "exit" option, the programme continues running.
